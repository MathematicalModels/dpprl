# dpprl

A DPP implementation on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Movies Recommendation System from the paper:

Zhao, X., Zhang, L., Xia, L., Ding, Z., Yin, D., & Tang, J. (2019). Deep reinforcement learning for list-wise recommendations.

The implementation is heavily built on top of:

egipcy. (2020). List-wise recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning. https://github.com/egipcy/LIRD. GitHub.

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 1.15
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Dppy

# Usage

Install required packages
run python deep-dpprl-dpp.py
